# [Inflow Finance](https://www.inflow.finance)'s website built with elm

## Build
To start the application, run the following command:  
```bash
make
```

> unfortunately, running the app using docker on the Apple M1 chip does not work at the moment.

You can still install [elm](https://elm-lang.org/) locally and start the application by running the following command:
```bash
make local-app
```
this installs elm using one of (brew, npm, yarn) if not already installed and then runs the application locally

## TODO: add tests
